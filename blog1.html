        <a>Overnight Layover "All night" in Seoul</a>
    </p>
    <p class="date">1 August 2019</p> 
    <div class="blogtext">
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>What happens when you book cheap flights to Europe? One finds themselves with an overnight layover in Seoul. 17 hours and 30mins. That’s how much time I had until my next flight…</p>
        <p>What was so good about this overnight layover was: </p>
        <p>1- exploring another destination; night-time Seoul </p>
        <p>2- adjusting my body clock. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Firstly, if you’re planning to leave the airport during a transfer, you need to fill in an arrival card. This has a big red box in the middle where you must fill in the address of your stay. Obviously, if you’re just going out for a few hours, you won’t be staying at a hotel or anywhere so just write “Transfer.” Also, don’t worry about the telephone number as many people wouldn’t have one at that stage. Don’t spend too long stressing over this like I did (I ended up having to ask an immigration officer what to write as this was my first ever transfer). </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Incheon International Airport is on a gigantic island off the coast, so it isn’t close to Seoul CBD. There are various options to travel into Seoul but the easiest and the most economical is the Metro. Unlike many cities around the world where you pay a premium to catch the airport train, the one in Seoul is very cheap. However, if you’re carrying heavy luggage (not me) you might want to consider a bus or the express train to save you hauling it up stairs and down long transfer tunnels. To make things easy if you’re catching the metro, buy a T-money card (contactless transportation card) from a convenience store like CU, GS25 or 7 Eleven. When I got mine, you could only load up a card with cash so visit an ATM before you get one. From Incheon airport, it takes at least one hour on the metro to get to Seoul CBD depending on where you want to go. So, factor this in and allow plenty of time to get back to the airport as the frequency of the airport metro is not as high as other trains. Also note that the last trains run just before 0100 and before 0000 on weekends and the first trains run from around 0530. So don’t make my mistake and realise there wasn’t a train because it was a Sunday night. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If you need internet when you’re out of the airport, you can rent a pocket Wi-Fi at the line of kiosks near the exit doors of Terminal 1 however they charge on a daily basis so it may not be the most economical for transfers. Otherwise, you can do what I did and download Korea Tour – Offline Maps using the airport’s free Wi-Fi. It wasn’t the best maps app, but it worked without internet and was reliable because Google Maps doesn’t work well in Korea. The equivalent is Naver Maps, but I failed to find an offline function. What you can also do is download a bunch of information on your phone using screenshots otherwise Google Chrome usually retains website viewing when you’re offline. But make sure you have a map of the Metro, so you know where you are going and how to get to places.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If you want to leave your bags, there are quite a few private luggage storage stores across Seoul. There are also lockers at many metro stations, and I saw some in shopping centres like Coex mall. You pay on an hourly basis however the lockers at the metro station are closed from 0100-0500 so you are unable to collect your bag during those hours. Also, many are located outside the station gates so when I left my bag at Hongik. Uni station, I went out just to collect my bag and went back in and it charged me an extra train ride. However, it is very convenient and easy to store luggage and the lockers are generally cheaper than the stores. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now onto the actual night life. I went to Myeongdong Night Market and wow the street food looked amazing! A lot of deep-fried mozzarella cheese, grilled cheese lobster, tornado potato, tteokbokki, hotteok, fishcakes, fried chicken you name it! Unfortunately, the markets close relatively early at 2300 so I saw the closing of many vendors. I only got an assortment of fish cakes and damn the sweet chilli here is spicy (for one who has the lowest tolerance to spice). The one complaint I had was the rubbish, there weren’t many bins so there was just a lot of used cups, plates and other food stuff just lying around everywhere so if you do come here, please put your rubbish in the bin. </p>

        <p>Dongdaemun Design Plaza is a nice place to check out because it’s accessible 24/7. There are pianos for you to play and the building is very futuristic. It was almost midnight and people are just chilling, playing on the pianos and just relaxing. There’s also no harm in wandering around the streets at night and just enjoying the neon lights, the hundreds of electric wires strung across the poles and the empty but open stores. Another thing I realised is that most people walking around, even at this time, are females just walking alone and simultaneously on their phones. Seoul is a very safe city. </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Where the city never sleeps is Hongdae. This is where all the clubs are located. Even at 3am on a Monday morning, there are long queues into clubs and a lot of traffic on the roads. There is definitely a lot of energy here. But if you’re like me and wanted some peace and quiet, try and find a café however there aren’t too many in the area. There are internet and book cafes that are often open 24/7 if you just want to relax before you take the train back to the airport. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Finally, what I want to talk about last is arguably the most important for a layover: the airport. Incheon International is a gigantic airport with many facilities so even if you do stay at the airport, there are plenty of ways to pass the time. There are Nap zones for sleeping located in various places across the airport, some are near gates and some are secluded. Make your way to the Transfers lounge and there is a large nap zone and even showers free of charge. There are many gardens, a casino, movie theatre, ice skating and many more. Free transit tours are also available but obviously they don’t run overnight. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The verdict is Seoul is a great place for an overnight layover, whether or not you want to leave the airport. It has the night life and it has the airport facilities. Although, I felt I didn’t enjoy it as much as I could as I was only there for a few hours at an unusual time so I couldn’t take in the full experience. I feel like layovers are good for places you know and already visited so you don’t waste time and eat that yummy food that you’ve been craving or go to that magical place of yours. But, hey, if you’re here by chance, why not go out and explore the nightlife of Seoul?</p>
