        <a>Opal Hacks on Sydney Transport</a>
    </p>
    <p class="date">21 December 2019</p> 
    <div class="blogtext">
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Did you know that the Opal card has many, many perks? You may think Sydney Transport is expensive but the Opal card that serves all major transportation across Sydney is easily hackable if you know the rules. This affects trains, buses, light rail, metro and ferries.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Save on off-peak travel</b></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Transport for NSW (TfNSW) advertises off peak fares as a 30% discount however, it’s better to think of it as a 30% increase in fares so you’re mentally prepared to save. This is generally the most straightforward way to maximise your savings. The peak hour times only apply to metro/trains and differ according to the station where you tapped on. Peak hour mostly covers 0600 to 0800 and 1600 to 1830 Monday to Friday. Make sure you tap on before or after peak hour otherwise even if you’re a minute late or early then it will cost you significantly more. It’s not uncommon to see a large group of people waiting outside the gates waiting for the clock to tick past the peak hour threshold before tapping on. Note that your tap off time is not considered, only the time when you tap on. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Zone based travel</b></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>All fares are distanced based and separated into different zones. You can save by ensuring you don’t travel just over the threshold. For example, Blacktown to Central costs $3.60 (adult on peak, as of Dec 2019) while Blacktown to Town Hall, only one stop more, will cost $4.82 because it falls under the next distance zone. So instead of catching the train one more stop, you can either walk if it’s within walking distance (which Town Hall is) or catch the bus utilising the transfer discount. Obviously, this case applies if you have some time to spare and you’re not in a rush. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Transfer discounts</b></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The most cost-saving benefit of the Opal card is that trips taken within an hour of each other are considered one single trip. Hence if you take the bus and get off at 1200, as long as you tap on again before 1300 it will count as one trip and potentially cost you nothing. For example, if you travel to one place and stay there for less than an hour, the return trip will be free. Otherwise, you can utilise this method to go to many places for a small fraction of the price. So, if you take the train from Central to Town Hall then et off and go back on and catch the train to Circular Quay and then catch the train to Museum, 3 train rides will cost the price of one.</p> 
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The more commonly used feature is switching between modes of transport such as from bus to train or vice versa. When you switch, you get a large discount ($2 for adults, $1 for child/concession/senior). Often this makes a short bus trip cost only a few cents.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Weekly travel reward </b></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Once eight trips are completed in a week (counting from Monday to Sunday), all trips following are half price. This is just a nice perk if you’re travelling anyways. Note the transfer discount when switching between modes of transport is also halved. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Sunday travel cap </b></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>All travel, regardless of how many trips you take is capped at $2.80 (as of Dec 2019, except $2.50 for seniors). So, you can use Sundays to your advantage to travel far and wide on the Sydney network, or catch those relatively expensive ferries. </p>
